# Mental Mapping

>  Readers shouldn’t have to mentally translate your names into other names they already
know. This problem generally arises from a choice to use neither problem domain terms
nor solution domain terms

* This is a problem with single-letter variable names. Certainly a loop counter may be
named i or j or k (though never l!) if its scope is very small and no other names can conflict with it. This is because those single-letter names for loop counters are traditional.


* However, in most other contexts a single-letter name is a poor choice; it’s just a place
holder that the reader must mentally map to the actual concept. There can be no worse reason for using the name c than because a and b were already taken.
