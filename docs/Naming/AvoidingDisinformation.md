# Avoid Disinformation

> Programmer must avoid leaving false clues that obscure the meaning of code.


* Using hp,aix and sc would be poor variable names they are names of Unix platform or variants.

* Hypotenuse and hp looks like good fit but it could be disinformative.

* Dont refer to a grouping of accounts as an accountList unless its actually a List. So accountGroup or accounts would be better.

* Dont use lower case L or uppercase o as variable name. They look liike a zero and one .
