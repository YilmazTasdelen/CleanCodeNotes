# Pick One Word For Concept

>  Pick one word for one abstract concept and stick with it. For instance, it’s confusing to
have fetch, retrieve, and get as equivalent methods of different classes. 

* How do you remember which method name goes with which class? 
 Otherwise, you spend an awful lot of time browsing through headers and
previous code samples.


* Likewise, it’s confusing to have a controller and a manager and a driver in the same
code base. What is the essential difference between a DeviceManager and a ProtocolController? Why are both not controllers or both not managers? Are they both Drivers
really? 

* The name leads you to expect two objects that have very different type as well as
having different classes.
