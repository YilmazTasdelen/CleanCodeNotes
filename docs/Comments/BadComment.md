# Bad Comments

> Most comments fall into this category. Usually they are crutches or excuses for poor code or justifications for insufficient decisions, amounting to little more than the programmer talking to himself

# Mumbling

        public void loadProperties(){
            try
            {
             String propertiesPath = propertiesLocation + "/" + PROPERTIES_FILE;
             FileInputStream propertiesStream = new FileInputStream(propertiesPath);
             loadedProperties.load(propertiesStream);
            }
            catch(IOException e){
                // No properties files means all defaults are loaded
            }
        }

* What does that comment in the catch block mean? Clearly it meant something to the author, but the meaning does not come through all that well.

# Reduntant Comment

* Listing 4-1 shows a simple function with a header comment that is completely unnecessarly long.The comment probably takes longer to read than the code itself.

        // Utility method that returns when this.closed is true. Throws an exception
        // if the timeout is reached.
        public synchronized void waitForClose(final long timeoutMillis)
        throws Exception
        {
         if(!closed)
           {
            wait(timeoutMillis);
            if(!closed)
                throw new Exception("MockResponseSender could not be closed");
        }
* What purpose does this comment serve? Itâ€™s certainly not more informative than the
code. It does not justify the code, or provide intent or rationale. It is not easier to read than
the code
