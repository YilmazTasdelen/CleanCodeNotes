# Do One Thing

>  FUNCTIONS SHOULD DO ONE THING. THEY SHOULD DO IT WELL.
THEY SHOULD DO IT ONLY


* It should be very clear that having at many different levels of abstraction is clearly doing more than one thing.

> Sections within Functions

*  Notice that the  function is divided into sections such as 

        * declarations,
        * initializations, 
        * calculation. 

  This is an obvious symptom of doing more than one thing.Functions that do one thing cannot be reasonably divided into sections.
