# Error Enums or Classes

> Returning error codes usually implies that there is some class or enum in which all the error codes are defined.

    public enum Error {
        OK,
        INVALID,
        NO_SUCH,
        LOCKED,
        OUT_OF_RESOURCES,
        WAITING_FOR_EVENT;
    }

> Classes like this are a dependency magnet; many other classes must import and use them. Thus, when the Error enum changes, all those other classes need to be recompiled and redeployed.

* This puts a negative pressure on the Error class. Programmers donâ€™t want to add new errors because then they have to rebuild and redeploy everything. So they reuse old error codes instead of adding new ones.

* When you use exceptions rather than error codes, then new exceptions are derivatives of the exception class.
